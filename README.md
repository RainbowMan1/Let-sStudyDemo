# Let's Study Demo

This program was used as a demo to pitch for Howard University AT&T Hackathon's Let's Study app. It uses data from edX courses to find how related each fields are which is then used to cluster groups of student together. The csv file "csv - Sheet1.csv" is acts as database for users and the data is used to cluster users based on their interests and education level. The program takes a random sample of 20 different users from the total data to demonstrate the different ways the program clusters users and saves the plot in "Cluster.png" file.
