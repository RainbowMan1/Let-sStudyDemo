# Let-sStudyDemo

This program was used as a demo to pitch for Howard University AT&T Hackathon's Let's Study app. It uses data from edX courses to find how related each fields are which is then used to cluster groups of student together. The csv file is used as database for users and the data is used to cluster users based on their interests and education level. The program takes a random sample of 20 different users from the total data to demonstrate the different ways the program clusters users.
